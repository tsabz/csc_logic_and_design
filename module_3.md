## Cecilia's Boutique wants several lists of salesperson data. Design a flowchart or pseudo-code for the following:

## A program that accepts one salesperson's :

## ID number,

## number of items sold in the last month,

## total value of the items,

## displays data message only if the salesperson is a high performerâ€”defined as a person who sells more than 200 items in the month.

## Ensure that the output showcases the appropriate flag so that Cecilia can provide an accolade to the salesperson.

---

create a variable called ID
create a variable called num_item_sold
create a variable called total_value
create a variable called high_preformer
Ask user for ID
Ask user for num_item_sold
Ask user for total_value

high_preformer == true if ID.num_item_sold is greater than 200

if high_preformer?
Display message "Congrats Sales Person #{ID} You win an accolade"
else
Display message "No accolade's granted at this time"
